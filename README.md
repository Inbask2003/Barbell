## Todo:
* Get a real name
* Don't just copy PhotonVision's website

## Developing

This is mainly just here so that I don't forget

### Libraries Used

* Python 3
* FastAPI
* SQLModel
* SlowAPI
* Jinja
* Bootstrap

### Running Locally
Linux:
```bash
# Pre-requirements
# * Have git installed
# * Have Python 3 installed

# Setup
git clone "https://github.com/crummyh/frcVisionDataset.git"
cd frcVisionDataset
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Now start working!
# To run the app run:
FastAPI dev app/main.py
# When you are done run:
deactivate
```

Windows:
Good luck, have fun!

Mac:
Probably similar to the Linux instructions, good luck!
