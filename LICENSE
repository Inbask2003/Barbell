{ This section is not part of the license }

This license is very similar to the MIT license, just it bans commercial use without my permission. If you have any questions, send an email to elijah@crums.us. This means that the project is not open source, rather is "source-available"

I chose to  make this license in order to reserve the right to commercialize the project in the future if I want to.
